## The Problem

> "We want to analyze student-generated JavaScript code (for our CS platform: https://www.khanacademy.org/cs) and determine if certain aspects of their code is written as expected."

The solution must include three kinds of testing methods:
* Whitelist: "The program must contain a for loop and an if statement."
* Blacklist: "The program must not use a while loop."
* Structural analysis: "The program must use a for loop, inside of which should be an if statement."
